With the recent scandals involving the world’s largest social network, there is a need for non-intrusive, specific social networks that are isolated from the mountains of nonsense that litter these sites.

Reclusiam aims to solve this issue by offering a service specific to those seeking refuge - a place where hobbyists, tabletop gamers and dungeon masters can come together and connect with like-minded individuals in a place free from the politics and weight of the ‘everyday’ social network.

Built as a full stack web app; utilizes MLab Mongo DB, Node with Express, built in React.js.
